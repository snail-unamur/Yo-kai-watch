Interview #6 2022-04-07 09-03


[00:00:32] Interviewee: B D C E A
[00:00:48] Interviewer: Okay, great. All right. Well, same question
[00:01:32] Interviewee: D A C E D 
[00:05:12] Interviewee: 2, 5, 4, 1, 3.
[00:06:37] Interviewee: Okay. I'm just trying to explore, you know, the basic commands, to be sure that I see how to use it.
[T:CONTROLS-INTUITIVE] [00:07:54] Interviewee: in fact I think, I’m trying to, uh, you know get the logic and [00:08:00] get the mapping through the code analysis functionality and what it should bring.
[00:08:15] Interviewer: So you have already first fought about. What would be the link between? 
[00:08:22] Interviewee: uh, so yeah, I, I can understand the fact that you can explore, you can explore the, I mean, I can choose, some file to explore, um, what is not clear yet, but you know, it’s just the beginning, I guess it's normal, uh, is you know what could be the — in fact. [00:08:48] Because if I try to think about, uh, my usage of a SonarQube or other tools, I don’t know even, even — or other tool like that, uh, you don't really have actions or it's just administration actions, uh, like saying that it's a false positive or something like that, uh, but you don’t really correct the bug into the tool.
[T:USER_AGENCY-LACKING] [00:09:15] You come back to your code base and you push some new commits to improve your code. And here I see that there are some actions, or in fact, I was wondering why uh, you know, what, what are the actions about. That’s the main point I’m trying to get right now. 
[00:09:42] Interviewer: Okay. You mean [00:09:43] like the goal of the game or not? 
[00:09:47] Interviewee: Yeah. And also because I see that I can use this attack command and it seems like I can kill the code smells.
[00:09:58] Interviewer: So you're wondering if killing the code smells does something. 
[00:10:05] Interviewee: Yeah, because if I try to think about the same thing in, let's say SonarQube. Uh, you are not killing the code smells in SonarQube, you’re killing the code smells in your code.
[T:FREEZE_INFORMATION-INTUITIVE] [00:10:19] That's what I was wondering, in fact. So yeah, here I see the numbers I guess it's different types of, uh, issues with the code. *Open freeze menu and read*
[T:VULNS-NOTICED] [T:BUGS-NOTICED] [T:CODE_SMELLS-NOTICED] [T:MONSTER_SIZE-INTUITIVE] [00:10:42] So, I mean, that's the level of priorities of the different types of issues, the size of the figures we have here, vulnerabilities, bugs and code smells.
[00:11:20] So, yeah, I am still wondering about the actions here. Here it's a different representation, a different way to display all the things about issues and code. Uh, but yet, in fact, maybe it’s just to add some video games in fact.
[T:MAP-PACKAGE_STRUCTURE] [T:ROOM-PACKAGE_STRUCTURE] [00:11:52] *Player in the room of an issue, opens the map and goes back to root* Yeah. Here, I can change the file. [00:11:57] I guess it seems to me that here I'm like in a folder.
[00:12:10] Interviewer: Yeah, this is like the tutorial rooms. So yes, folders and files of the tutorial, but maybe you can if you’re ready exit the tutorial and a go for, uh, for a project. Okay. So here, basically you are in the project selection. You can choose basically any public project that uses SonarCloud. If you search for it, uh, at the top, or you can just choose the recommended project that we put here, it's the brave software.
[T:LEARNING_CURVE-MEDIUM] [00:12:59] Interviewee: *Picked up brave and loading* I think I forgot a little bit that it was just the tutorial *Slight laugh* that’s maybe why I was doing a few things that are not really — in the game *Project loading over* 
[T:CODE_SMELLS-NOTICED] Uh, [00:13:04] so yeah, I see all the bugs. [00:13:09] That is not only bugs but issues in fact. [00:13:13] and I see that I can kill them and of course the number of bugs are decreasing. I mean the number of issues at the end. At the end, I don't have any exit possible at the end, if there are too many issues, it’s just impossible for me.
[T:MONSTERS-ARE_ISSUES] [T:COMBAT-OVERWHELMING_IS_BAD_CODE] [00:13:52] Interviewee: I'm not sure what I can analyze at the same time, because [00:13:57] I can try to kill them as they're really a lot of them. It feels that in any case at the end, I will lose the game *Lose the game refers to dying I think*. What I can think about is that if I have all ten issues, maybe I will be able to win the game. If I have hundreds or even more issues like here and I guess it’s even more true if they are critical then it would be almost impossible for me to win this game in fact at the end.
[00:14:37] Interviewer: Did you get what are the squares on the ground? 
[T:FREEZE_INFORMATION-USEFUL] [00:14:47] Interviewee: Uh, I wasn't able to remember right now. *Open freeze menu to understand*
[T:FREEZE_INFORMATION-SUB_DIR_MISSING] [00:15:07] I'm not sure to understand, uh, squares. Here because I can see the different, uh, monsters.
[00:15:23] Interviewee: It means that you have 2 criteria. In fact, you have one criteria for the type of issues, vulnerabilities, bugs and code smells. And, uh, then you have another criteria that you displayed in the game in fact. This one is less clear to me. Okay. What you want to represent, here. 
[00:15:48] Interviewer: Uh, maybe you will understand if I tell you that the squares on the ground basically represent either files or directories like subdirectories. [00:16:00] 
[T:COLORS-GENERAL_QUALITY] [00:16:01] Interviewee: Okay. So it's more, uh, uh, not the amount, uh, the level of issues that you have in one file or folder, uh,
[00:16:18] Interviewer: And you can of course, like dig in, um, some folders or directories.
[T:PERFECT_ROOM_PERFECT_CODE] [00:16:29] Interviewee: *Enters perfect room* I think, okay nothing in this room. *Go up* I can try this one for instance. *Enter a room perfect colors but 2 smells* Here I guess I can *Kill monsters* *Open freeze menu* So in this one it was still in green, so I have to try another one. *Go down* Oh no — *Back to root, then orange ground room*
[00:17:26] Interviewer: What are your thoughts about this room, for example, what do you think it's tries to tell you about the code quality?
[T:SECURITY_METRIC-NOT_INTUITIVE] [T:MAINTAINABILITY_METRIC-NOT_INTUITIVE] [T:RELIABILITY_METRIC-NOT_INTUITIVE] [00:17:38] Interviewee: This one. In fact, what is still unclear to me is, uh, you know, the criteria that is represented here *In the freeze panel the walls of security*. So what is the value, uh, with the different colors. 
[00:17:54] Interviewer: Okay. Yeah. You don't get the scale that we use.
[T:MONSTER_NUMBER-INTUITIVE] [T:MONSTER_SIZE-INTUITIVE] [00:18:00] Interviewee: Yeah, because here *pointing to monsters in the information panel in the freeze mode*, I, I imagine. Uh, you have the low priority, high priority and critical priority code smells. Same for the bugs and vulnerabilities.
[00:18:13] But yeah, the measure here is not that clear to me *Pointing to the 3 panels of walls, ground and cracks*.
[00:18:19] Interviewer: Uh, then I should probably tell you, the colors represent the rating of the entire file or directory. So, uh, the black is like the worst and the green is the best. So if there are not a lot of bugs, for example, well it will be a green ground.
[T:ROOM-PACKAGE_STRUCTURE] [00:18:47] Interviewee: Okay. So it means that you can, you can see, uh. So that's, uh, here *In root* I have an overview of all the files or folders for instance. *Trying to go to a file through the mob and die* Oh.
[T:MOUSE-NOT_FOUND] [00:19:10] Interviewer: You can also press X to freeze, because with that you can move around the camera. And when you left click, you can actually go inside a square.
[00:19:29] Interviewee: *Click not on purpose on a mob and access the issue*
[00:19:30] Interviewer: Yeah, if you click on the issue, it opens.
[T:FREEZE_FREEZE-FOUND] [T:FILE_HOVER-INTUITIVE] [00:19:41] Interviewee: *Move around the camera with keyboard and hover files* Okay. Okay. 
[00:19:56] Interviewer: And you can actually navigate like this, by left clicking on a square, it comes inside and then right click. It goes up,
[T:MOUSE-NOT_FOUND] [00:20:07] Interviewee: *Try to right click on a file in root* Uh, you say I can right click?
[00:20:10] Interviewer: Left click. *Player goes into a file* And if you right-click, now you will go back up to the level of the world. 
[00:20:20] Interviewer: you can actually also use the map to navigate. 
[00:20:30] Interviewee: Yeah. Okay. *Enter a folder* So here you have a folder. *Enters a file* And you can continue till you find a file I guess. *Go back to root* Here they are almost all green. *Goes into another one with reliability D and 1 issue*
[00:20:54] Interviewer: So for example, this folder, what would be the code quality rating, severity of the issues in this folder according to you? 
[T:LEGEND_SCALE_DIRECTION-INTUITIVE] [T:LEGEND_SCALE_DIRECTION-LEFT_TO_RIGHT] [00:21:06] Interviewee: What it would be. So, you know, I guess here it’s quite bad, uh, at least, it’s what I would say as it is in red and I can see only the dark one as —.
[00:21:20] So I, I would guess that this is, this is the worst *Dark and red*. Uh . If it's green, it would be a good point for this file.
[00:21:37] Interviewer: Uh, while playing, did you feel at any point, overwhelmed by the information in the game, like. Too much information or maybe on the contrary, like not enough information for you to understand? 
[T:GOAL-LACKING] [T:GOAL-SUMMARY] [00:21:51] Interviewee: No, I think it was consistent, my, my main, my main question, I think is still to understand why I am playing for. So I can get, uh, the display, now I better understand what is displayed, like I can have an overview and then I can just browse any subfolders, files. With the colors I can know what is the level of quality in fact of each file and folders.
[T:GOAL-LACKING] [T:GOAL-FUN] [T:GOAL-CONFUSING] [00:22:20] What I am still wondering is what is the objective of playing the game, but maybe this is just a game with no objective. And so there is no reason to think about that. Uh, but yeah, this is the main remaining question I have. Why am I playing the game. So I can see the value, I can understand the value to represent this way, it could become more fun.
[00:23:00] And so maybe useful for developers, more readable in some manner. But about playing the game. Maybe I search too much why am I playing the game.
[00:23:14] Interviewer: I will actually tell you now, uh, the goal is not very clear because there is no goal, like killing all the bugs or anything. It's more like a visualization tool. So you go through your project and fighting the enemies is supposed to tell you how difficult it is to fix the bugs that you are. [00:23:40] So if there is, like, when you said at the beginning, a lot of bugs coming at you and it's you just keep dying. It means that, okay, this folder has a big problem because I can't get through it. So this is more like the goal, but there is no goal like killing the bugs. It won't do anything. If you manage to kill all the bugs, this means that there are not too many bugs they are manageable.
[T:GOAL-NEED_EXPLANATION] [00:24:08] Interviewee: Okay. So maybe about the instruction and, uh, the, the data that this is offering information, or maybe some few you can mention here *in the information panel in the freeze mode*, or I guess you, if someday you share with more people it’s something that would be explained more properly. But yeah to me, it was something maybe missing, because I feel that I was spending a lot of time in my mind, to understand why I was playing in fact. 
[T:COMBAT-NO_LESSON] I was more focus on that part than on the visual part and what this file is, I was trying to understand what would be the consequence of killing the bugs in the game.
[00:24:52] Interviewer: Yeah. Yeah. A lot of people told us that in the interviews. So you're not the first one. Yeah. 
[T:DEV-POSITIVE] [T:SCENARIO-DEBT_FIGHT_ENGAGEMENT] [T:GOAL-FUN] [T:FIXING_RATIONALE-BEING_OVERWHELMED] [00:25:02] Interviewee: So yeah. In fact, it's about, you know, the impact. In fact, seeing that you have all the bugs against you, it’s quite visual. And so I, yeah, I guess I think it would be useful to developers, uh, and it would be fun also. I think it can help developers in fact, to, um, to have in mind and to, uh, to really see how many bugs they have, and how difficult it  would be to kill all of them for really in the code itself.
[00:25:34] Interviewer: So when you say that the tool would be useful for developers, do you think that it would be useful also for other kinds of roles, like, uh, who are not developers, but maybe like project managers or anything else? Really? 
[T:MANAGER-POSITIVE] [T:DEV-POSITIVE] [T:SCENARIO-COMMUNICATION] [00:25:52] Interviewee: Yeah, I think so. Yeah. Maybe, maybe you can also inform project managers or people around the developers.
[T:THREAT-IMPOSED_TOOL] [00:25:59] I think the only point is to make sure that people want to go this way. That they have a willingness to play this game. Because, on the contrary, if this is a kind of replacement in the tools of the team and it becomes at some point, the only way to have an overview of the number of issues. [00:26:29] Maybe some people will not want to play this game and they will not want to use this tool. So yeah, I think that for some it would work but I would pay attention that it doesn't create more frustration for the people that don’t want to play the game.
[00:26:51] Uh, but I guess it's not only for the developers it's more about: “do you see the fun and do you want to play this game” and yeah also for people around the project, I don’t know, project owner or for project managers it could be also fun to have this game in addition to the usual tools for static code analysis. 
[00:27:18] Interviewer: Okay. And, um, if you would, uh, use this, I don't know if you would use this game in your everyday life as a developer. 
[T:ME-POSITIVE] [00:27:30] Interviewee: Yeah. Yeah. I said, in addition to SonarSource for instance, SonarQube. I think it could be fun to add this one and at least to let the developers put in place the game. And automate, uh, I don’t know how it works behind, but I guess you can, uh, you can have one per branch, for instance, like you have for those static code analysis.
[00:27:58] If you take the habit as a developer, uh, and you know, uh, how to enter the game, uh, you are used to navigate in the game and you see the number of bugs decreasing it could be fun I think.
[00:28:15] Interviewer: When would you use this too? Like, is it something that you would use everyday to see the technical debt and everything, or only at some points or like when would be the right time.
[T:GAMIFICATION-MISSING] [T:GOAL-FUN] [00:28:27] Interviewee: I think, if you want to make it, uh [00:28:29] Um, I would say you, uhm, not useful. I'm not sure it would be useful in a day to day work. But what I can see is that adding this touch of fun. It could be useful in the life of the team, it could be useful in addition to the usual tools, as I said. Um, but to me, what would be missing is just, uh, maybe some, um, uh, you know, some more levels, uhm, some more games in fact, some more different levels in the game. More common also, not only one common for attack and so on. You would need more gameplay, more things in the game to make it fun overtime.
[00:29:05] You know, because here I can see that if I suggest to some developers to use it they would be really pleased. And I think they will want to try, but after a few time they play this game it would appear a bit limited and you know, they will say “now I understood the point” and if you want to keep the people playing this game you will need more things in the game
[00:29:46] Interviewer: Yeah. Okay. Yeah. You mean the gameplay's maybe a bit limited and there are not a lot of things to do except for fighting with one sword.
[00:30:02] Interviewer: Do you feel like motivated to fix the bugs when you play this game? If this was your project, would you feel motivated to say like, okay, I see that these are the problems I, now I will go fix them into code. 
[T:GAMIFICATION-MISSING] [T:INSTANT_FEEDBACK_FIXING-NEED_SCORE] [00:30:22] Interviewee: Um, maybe orienting to what we just say that, uh, in fact, you know, if you can ask some kind of score that you can improve each time you decrease the number of bugs and issues you will want to go back to the game. Here maybe the point is that each time, so you would just see that you have less monsters. So it's maybe limitated and in my opinion, you will need some kind of score, uh, it may be quite straightforward, like the number of monsters that you killed overtime.
[00:30:59] Uh, and you can imagine some kind of a challenge between team members on that. Or maybe something more complicated. But here, maybe it's a little bit limited to truly give the impression that it would be useful to help you solve the issue. 
[00:31:26] Interviewer: And finally, uh, did you, what did you like about the game or dislike that you haven't yet covered, talked about? Is there anything else that you would like to say? 
[T:FREEZE_INFORMATION-USEFUL] [00:31:37] Interviewee: Uh, no, what I’ve said was quite clear. I liked the fact that you consider having the freezer screen with all the instructions, it is quite useful, and, if you don’t have it I think it would be complicated to play the game. So to me, it's a really good point that you think about providing this kind of a usage screen. In fact, it's really important.
[T:MONSTERS-INTUITIVE] [T:ROOM_INFORMATION-NOT_INTUITIVE] [00:32:09] And maybe, for the colors, yeah here *For the wall, ground and cracks* I had more difficulties to understand, um, what was the objective, here *Talking about the monsters* was quite clear to me, but here *wall, ground and cracks* it was more complicated for me to understand what was the purpose of this part. Uh, but, uh, no, then I think we discussed most of the feedback I can share.
