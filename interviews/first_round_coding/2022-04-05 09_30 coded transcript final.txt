[T:LEARNING_CURVE-MEDIUM] [T:VULNS-HARD_RECALL] [T:BUGS-HARD_RECALL] [T:CODE_SMELLS-HARD_RECALL] [00:01:49] *Enter the first room of brave-core project* So I don't remember which enemy was, which so let's see, 
[T:BUGS-NOTICED] [T:VULNS-NOTICED] [T:CODE_SMELLS-NOTICED] [T:FREEZE_INFORMATION-USEFUL] *Turn on freeze mode* I'm looking at, so these are mostly code smells and bugs. I don't see any vulnerabilities. [00:02:05] Having that freeze menu there is helpful.
[00:02:11] *Dying* Alright, I died
[T:VOLUME-TOO_LOUD] [00:02:16] Just going to reduce the volume here of the game, it's a little loud.
[T:VOLUME-NOT_MODIFIABLE] [00:02:41] um, it looks like I can’t adjust the volume of the game independently. See if I just have to speak up a little bit.
[T:COMBAT-OVERWHELMING_IS_BAD_CODE] [00:02:58] Yeah, it feels like there's [00:03:00] a lot of enemies here and they're kind of overwhelming me, uh, in terms of how fast I can attack. Yeah. Maybe that's a sign that there are too many problems with the code.
[T:PERFECT_ROOM_PERFECT_CODE] [00:03:26] *Dig into a perfect file room* So this is fine.
[T:MONSTER_NUMBER-SUM_SUBDIRECTORIES] [00:03:30] So burrowing down into like a sub level. Is it more manageable? That makes sense.
[T:ROOM-PACKAGE_STRUCTURE] [T:FILE_NAME_INDICATOR-NOTICED] [00:03:41] So, yes, this looks like, um, sub-levels are sub-directories, uh, walking over different areas. I see like “page specifics”, “CSS”. So these look like individual files and more directories I can dig into. [00:04:00] I’ll dig in here *dig in a folder*. Yes. *Walk over some tiles* “HTML file”, “HTML file”, “HTML file”. That looks like another directory. [00:04:08] I can dig in here. Yeah. Yeah. Files are probably a dead end. What if I dig into a file? So if I go into a single file. It's a dead end because there's no other files in a file. Um,
[T:MONSTER_RESPAWN-NOT_INTUITIVE] [T:GOAL-KILL_ALL_MONSTERS] [00:04:32] Kill all these guys here. *Killing the 15 monsters alive in the room* [00:04:43] Will there be no more guys in the highest level? [00:05:02] It looks like this is still coming out of here.
I would expect them to not come after killing them, yeah. When you dig down and kill people, they shouldn’t come back up. 
[T:FILE_NAME_INDICATOR-DISCRETE] Yeah, I'm finding it took me a little while to notice the, the changing, like directory name slash like file name was I walk over different stuff and 
[T:COMBAT-PACE_OVERWHELMING]I think I'm so focused on everything else  [00:05:33] that's going on the street that is more immediate things, being that the horde of enemies.
[T:RELIABILITY_METRIC-NOTICED]
[T:SECURITY_METRIC-NOTICED] [00:05:47] I definitely noticed the tiles' color changing. Um, I haven't really noticed changing wall [00:06:00] colors.[00:06:05] Looking closely, it looked all green so far.
[T:FREEZE_INFORMATION-USEFUL] [00:06:13] [Interviewer] And, uh, what would these colors indicate? [Interviewee] Um, yeah, like I would think about the severity of the issues. Let’s see, let’s read X *Turn on freeze*. Yeah, vulnerability, um, from walls, floors, vulnerability walls is security and cracks maintainability. I guess something I can read here, but it's also 
[T:RELIABILITY_METRIC-HARD_RECALL] [T:SECURITY_METRIC-HARD_RECALL] like during the game, something that I kind of forget.
[T:BUGS-HARD_RECALL] [T:CODE_SMELLS-HARD_RECALL] [T:VULNS-HARD_RECALL] [T:MONSTERS-ARE_ISSUES] [T:MONSTERS-INTUITIVE][00:06:45] Yeah. Which things represent, smells, bugs, vulnerabilities is definitely said. But I don't think of it while playing the game. I just see the enemies.
[T:MONSTER_SIZE-INTUITIVE] *Enters a room with one critical bug* So like, you know, being in this room and seeing that there's one big enemy makes me think that, you know, this file has one big problem. But it's not a thing that I feel like I'll really remember, like program browser or app data XML in Chrome installer, Lennox, competence, or browser. 
Like seeing this. I don't think it's gonna, like once I leave I’ll remember that. Also, I'm not familiar with this code base, I'm sure that plays a part of it. Um, but yeah, just, just seeing that one enemy there. Does really make me think like, oh, this is important. 
[T:VULNS-NOTICED] One thing that I think would be pretty noticeable though, like I'm not seeing, maybe I should try a different project, but I'm not seeing any of these red guys. [00:07:45] Uh, I feel like if I were to see one, it would really bring my focus to it and make me aware of that.
[00:08:04] *Back to project selection*
[T:COMBAT-PACE_OVERWHELMING] [00:08:16] [Interviewer] Did you feel overwhelmed by the information in the game, too much information or too little information? [Interviewee] Um, I wouldn't say overwhelmed by the information, but I would say overwhelmed by the pace of it. [00:08:36] Like there were so many enemies at once that I couldn't really, I was thinking more about the game itself rather than what does this represent? Like, what am I supposed to be taking from this? Like, you know, when I dug down a little bit to some of the quieter rooms, I would see, you know, okay, this file has three green enemies. Okay.
[T:BUGS-HARD_RECALL] [T:CODE_SMELLS-HARD_RECALL] [T:VULNS-HARD_RECALL] [T:COMBAT-PACE_OVERWHELMING] What are green enemies? Okay, those are bugs. Uh, you know, then it was a little bit more manageable, but definitely some of the higher levels. Yeah. Too busy focusing on the enemies and not dying that I couldn’t think about what bugs represent.
[T:ATTACK_SPEED-LOW] [00:09:13] [Interviewer] Now, what did you think about how the combat was going? [Interviewee] Um, I mean, from a gameplay perspective, um, like a little, a little clunky, or maybe just a little slow, like the attack speed, a little slow. 
[T:COMBAT-NO_LESSON] Um, but yeah, like I didn't feel a strong connection between, um, what the gameplay is doing and what the plot is supposed to be in terms of fighting. [00:09:50] Um, fighting off bugs and fighting tech debt. Like I think, I think the words, like little narrative dissonance, like, I didn't feel like there was, uh, a clear line between addressing tech debt and what the gameplay was, which was just fighting monsters. 
[Interviewer] So did you see, like, what would be the goal of the game, or it wasn't clear enough.
[T:GOAL-LACKING] [T:GOAL-KILL_ALL_MONSTERS] [00:10:18] [Interviewee] Um, I assume the goal was to just kill all the enemies, but maybe not because killing them at a sub level. They seem to just come back when I dig back up or go back into those rooms. So yeah, I guess if it's not just killing all the enemies then yeah I'm not sure what the goal is. 
[Interviewer] Do you feel motivated to fix tech when playing that game? Did you feel like it's engaging and you want to fix the debt or not?
[T:ME-NEGATIVE][T:FIXING-NEGATIVE] [T:FIXING-PRIORITIZATION_REQUIRED] [00:10:47] [Interviewee] Um, not, not particularly. And I think the [00:11:00] reason for that is just because there was like a huge horde of enemies all at once. Like I think if there was maybe some more like prioritization, like if I could see like, oh, this level has a ton of enemies, um, or this directory has a ton of problems that would motivate me more to go and fix those. 
[T:COMBAT-PACE_OVERWHELMING] Um, but just seeing all the enemies of the whole, all the, all the problems with the whole project, all at one go, um, was I think just kind of overwhelming. 
[T:MAP-NOT_FOUND] [00:11:39] [Interviewer] There was a map, like when you press down TAB, there is a map. It can help you, maybe.
[T:MAP-USABILITY_GOOD] [T:MAP-PACKAGE_STRUCTURE] [00:11:54] [Interviewee] *Open the map* Okay. Yeah. So all the directories, and files. [00:12:06] Okay. So this just takes me down to the room.
[T:GOAL-KILL_ALL_MONSTERS] [00:12:16] *Killing every monsters* Let's clear up everyone.
[T:ROOM-PACKAGE_STRUCTURE] [00:12:25] It's like all the problems in this directory come from this sub-directory, *Enter the sub-directory which is a big room* which is a bunch of files. [00:12:34] *Open the map* So these are all the files within this. [00:12:44] *Go in a file* There's no enemies here. Can’t go down further.
[T:ISSUE_ACCESS-NOT_FOUND] [00:12:51] [Interviewer] And actually when you find enemies, you can press X to freeze time. And then if you click on the [00:13:00] enemies, it will open the actual cold smell in SonarCloud. 
[Interviewee] I didn't know that was that in the tutorials. I just missed that. No, it wasn't said, it was more like of a power user feature, like
[T:ISSUE_ACCESS-COOL][00:13:18] okay, cool. Interesting. Yeah. It takes me right to it. [00:13:24] Cool. Yeah. I don't think I would've figured it out. Okay.
[00:13:32] Let's take a look at one of the bigger guys.
[T:MONSTER_SIZE-NOT_INTUITIVE] [00:13:38] *Hover monsters* Critical bug, minor code smell, major code smell. Okay. I see. Interesting. I was wondering what, what the difference between the big guys and small guys was.[00:14:00] 
[00:14:03] [Interviewer] Do you think you would use this tool in your everyday life? 
[T:ME-NEGATIVE] [Interviewee] Um, personally? I don't, I don't think so. [T:ME-CLASSIC_VIS_EASIER] Uh, I feel like I would sooner just use one more traditional visualization. Cause like what I'm getting out of this is that in this directory here all of the problems are coming from this one, *Run into enemies to step on the file to know the name, then dies but the player did not react particularly to the death* “resources”. [00:14:32] Um, and so just having a more traditional visualization of it would probably be easier to get into. 
[T:ME-GAME_VIS_FUNNIER] Oh, well, that being said, I know it might be kind of fun to pick them out at random times. So, [00:14:51] it's like in a fight, just, you know, X click on, go through, find it, solve it. 
[T:INSTANT_FEEDBACK_FIXING-MISSING_DOUBT] [T:INSTANT_FEEDBACK_FIXING-MISSING] Um, [00:15:00] if, if I were to like, say, fix this right now, and then go back to the game with that guy, die for me having fixed it in the code. Is there any sort of like. [Interviewer] Yeah, basically like if you fix the bug and then SonarCloud makes a new analysis and doesn't find any bugs there. [00:15:20] It will remove it from the game. Okay. Yeah. Would there be a lot of latency there? I haven't used SonarCloud before. Oh, so is it something like, if I could fix it and then I would go back in the game and within a couple of seconds the monster will disappear. [Interviewer] I think, sadly, it will be a bit more than a couple of seconds because SonarCloud has to analyze your code or that's what I figured. [00:15:49] [Interviewee] Yeah. So, that's that sort of latency I wouldn't get the instant feedback of feeling like “pew pew pew”, like I'm killing the guy off by using the code [00:16:00] to get that hit from it. [Interviewer] Would it be more useful if it was like this? Like if you fix the bug, it will disappear from the game instantly or in a couple of seconds.[00:16:12] [Interviewee] I think so. Yeah. Yeah. Cause like, you know, in the game, you just hit him with a sword and then you have killed that enemy, but like, you know, they come back and haven't actually fixed anything as fixed the code smell. Whereas if I could click through, make changes or, have a way to actually like enter that I’ve fixed this. Cause SonarQube has to rerun the full thing and obviously going through commits to your code base and doing proper version control stuff. You don't want to encourage bad practices, but I mean, if you could fix it and then check off that I killed it or something like that, just, just cutting down. [00:16:59] [00:17:00] I think would make it a lot more satisfying. Um, but mind you, it also depends on what the problem itself is because I'm sure a lot of these things aren't things that you can’t just like, you know: “Oh, okay. Fix this.” Like it'll take some time to do, and that already gets you out of the flow of the game.[00:17:19] Um, so I'm not sure if that would even work anyway, just in terms of personal satisfaction of fixing things.
[Interviewer] Lastly, you said that you didn't like, feel like using this tool in your everyday life, but who would you see playing this game? If it's not you, do you think it's for someone? Um, maybe I don't know, students to insurers other software developers in other contexts managers or anything else. 
[00:18:00] [Interviewee] Just trying to think of different roles in orgs that have been in. [00:18:08] [T:TEAM-POSITIVE] I mean, it might be the sort of thing that I don't know, maybe a team might do, [T:SCENARIO-COMMUNICATION] [T:SCENARIO-DEBT_FIGHT_ENGAGEMENT] [T:FREQUENCY-AGILE] like during standup or once a week or once a sprint or something. Um, somebody playing around with it just as a way for the whole team to watch. Partially as a social, partially as a way to have people keeping their mind on tech debt without it feeling like a chore.
[T:SCENARIO-PEOPLE_PERFORMANCE_TRACKING] [00:18:36] Maybe tracking how well people do. And if the team is regularly losing and dying in the game, then that means that there's too much tech debt. Maybe they should prioritize it. Um, so I see it as being something that maybe a team could use as a fun way of engaging with tech debt.
[T:ME-NEGATIVE] [T:STRONG_INDIVIDUALS-NEGATIVE] [00:18:55] But, uh, outside of that, I can't [00:19:00] imagine myself, like sitting down individually and using this as a way to get a better understanding of tech debt. I can’t imagine, engineering managers or tech leads or the rules getting like strong individual use out of it any more than they would get from a more traditional visualization tool.
[00:19:24] [Interviewer] What did you like or dislike about the game that we haven't covered yet? 
[T:RAINBOW-INTUITIVE] [T:COLORS-MUSIC_CORRELATION_USEFUL] [00:19:48] Um, yeah, I felt like the colors were pretty straightforward. Um, I guess seeing [00:20:00] the correlation between volume and or severity and color to be useful. 
[T:ISSUE_ACCESS-USEFUL] Um, once I found out that you could click on an enemy to see the specific code issue, uh, I think that was useful. 
Um, Gameplay itself was like a little bit clunky.
[T:ENEMY_TYPE-DIFFERENTIABLE] [00:20:22] The different types of enemies I think were useful. Cause you can I, I mean, I, I didn't see any of the “vulnerability” enemies. But I feel like if I did see one of them, then I would have immediately honed in on that. So I think that would have been useful.
[00:20:49] I think that's most of my thoughts on it. 
[T:COMBAT-NO_LESSON] [T:GOAL-LACKING] But the main problem is, I didn't feel that there was a strong [00:21:00] correlation between what the game is about like code issues and the actual gameplay. And so. I didn't, I didn't feel that by playing it by fighting things, it really helped me understand things about the code base, um, or like gave me a better intuition or better understanding about the issues.
[T:FILE_TYPE-ADD_MAPPING] [00:21:31] So maybe introducing more thematic elements to the game that are directly related to, uh, the underlying files. So maybe. I don't know if you're, if you're in an HTML file, maybe the assets look a little bit different than they would if you're in a Python file, for instance. [00:21:55] The thematic elements of the game, better aligned with, [00:22:00] what the underlying source is, would probably make it more useful and more enjoyable. 
[Interviewer] Okay. Uh, you said that the gameplay was a bit clunky. Were you just referring to combat or something else? [Interviewee] Um, mainly combat, uh, it’s just like, I play a lot of video games. [00:22:22] [T:ATTACK_SPEED-LOW] So it just felt a little bit like the attack speed and the sheer number of enemies moving around felt a little bit like: “I want to do this but I can't.” 
[T:COMBAT-OVERWHELMING_IS_BAD_CODE] Maybe that's an intentional thing about it to make the user feel overwhelmed if there's too much code smell, which I would understand.
[T:EXPLORING-HARD_WHEN_MONSTERS] [00:22:40] Um, but there were a couple of times where it's like, oh, I want to go into, I see like a square over there. I want to dig into, but there's a thousand enemies on it, so I can't reach it. So my only way to get there is to use the map which just felt a little bit clunky.
[T:SUB_FOLDER_NAME-UNKNOWN] [00:23:00] Okay. I see that square, but I don't know what directory that is. So I don't know how to navigate to it in the directory list. 
[T:MOUSE-NOT_USED]  [Interviewer] Yeah. It wasn't maybe very clear, but you could actually like when you press X, it freezes and then you can click on the tiles to get inside of it. 
[Interviewee] Okay, I didn’t know that.


[T:MAP_SEARCH_BAR-NOT_USED]
