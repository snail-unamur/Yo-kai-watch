Rainbow used
[T:GAME_WINDOW-SMALL] [00:08:36] Interviewee: uh, can I zoom in. *Use the zoom feature of the browser*
[00:08:49] Interviewer: um, and we try not to give too much information about how it works. So you really have to like, try to discover and figure out how. Um, but while you [00:09:00] are doing this, please, uh, really say everything that comes to your mind and, um, yeah. So I can really get what you are thinking and thinking about the features and controls and yeah.
[T:CONTROLS-INTUITIVE] [00:09:17] Interviewee: Um, so I’m good to go then. Perfect. Um, okay. So, I mean, it looks like it's frozen now *In the tutorial, they have not tried to move yet. Here in the room no thing is moving there are only idle animations of characters*. It's like an unfreeze *Press X*. Oh, I save that back *Press X (actually unfreeze) and start moving* it's not frozen. 
[T:TUTORIAL-LEAVING_EARLY] Um, alright. Can dig. *Walk to escape tile and dig* Ok, not really what I wanted but..
[00:09:43] Interviewer: yeah, you exited the tutorial, but maybe a little too fast. So what I suggest is that you press escape and go back to it by pressing the button, just to make sure that you've seen everything. 
[00:09:56] Interviewee: Yeah. Yeah. Um, yeah, so I thought was not [00:10:00] necessarily, it would just, um,
[T:DIG_GO_UP-NOT_INTUITIVE] [00:10:06] yeah, that's it. Um, yeah, I thought that I would guess, like maybe make a hole that I could look at later and go in if I want to. *Killing all the monsters one by one, avoiding to dig*
[T:CONTROLS-INTUITIVE] [T:GOAL-KILL_ALL_MONSTERS] [00:10:17] Interviewee: — space. Um, can show. yeah. *Killed all the monsters in the tutorial* Um, I was like, yeah, I'm good to go. That's a good.
[00:10:42] Interviewer: So here right now, you are in the project selection. Um, basically you can select any project that you would like, uh, it's open source available in SonarCloud, but here, what I suggest is that we just go for the brave software, uh, recommended project at the top. So this will be easier for the testing.
[T:FIRST_ACTION-BROWSING] [T:RECOMMENDED-UNNOTICED] [00:11:16] Interviewee: *Was browsing first in the list then noticed the recommended one when said by the interviewer* Okay. Oh ok ok. 
*Game loaded* Everything's come at me. [00:11:22] Um, those things are different, uh, different types of monsters, whatever they represent.
[T:TILE_NUMBER-INTUITIVE] [00:11:57] When I kill something that changes the number on the squares out of that, but when I feel like it was something that changes the numbers on the squares or maybe it’s the amount spawned.
[00:12:16] Interviewee: At first it gives me the — —. That’s very overwhelming.
[00:12:27] Interviewer: And do you have any idea what the monsters represent? 
[T:MONSTERS-INTUITIVE] [T:MONSTERS-ARE_ISSUES] [00:12:32] Interviewee: I assume that they represent different types of —. So we have, uh, like for example, vulnerabilities and small ones that might just represent some bugs. 
[T:MONSTER_SIZE-INTUITIVE] And so from what it looks like, having health sort of doesn't match really with the size, does it, it's gonna be the simple fact that some, some of the biggest things, uh, things that are more like. The more, like, visible, easy to fix things, just leaving all these small things around. It's just kind of a slow sickness.
[T:FREEZE_KEY-HARD_RECALL] [00:13:24] Interviewer: When you press X, you freeze time, but you also might have a bit more information. 
[T:FREEZE_INFORMATION-USEFUL] [T:VULNS-NOTICED] [00:13:31] Interviewee: Oh yes. Okay. This makes sense. So code smells, bugs, vulnerabilities. Okay. Well, yeah, so I haven't seen a vulnerability yet. Um, yeah. Okay. So what you see is different, different types of code smells.
[T:CODE_SMELLS-NOTICED] [T:BUGS-NOTICED] [00:13:48] Um, but then yes, as I'm playing it, it feels like the bigger code smells are easy to kill. Um, And you, then what I'm seeing here, I think you really see big and medium code smells and it's not so much. There are small code smells, and then there are some bugs as well, but it's hard to, uh, say too much about them seeing a few of them on the screen.
[00:14:25] Um, I, I can dig kinda *Unfreeze and then try to dig in the bottom right corner being surrounded by a lot of monsters* Oh, uh, nothing, ok, make sense
[00:14:35] Interviewer: For the digging part, I don’t know if you completely understand how it works?
[T:DIG_KEY-INTUITIVE] [00:14:45] Interviewee: Oh, I can go on to maybe a square that, uh, *Try to force the way through the monsters to reach a square and die*, ugh, let me get there. *Respawn and rush a yellow square* Okay. Yeah. So you can go inside the thing. Okay.
[00:15:01] Interviewer: So have you figured out what the different rooms are? The squares on the ground and the rooms?
[T:ROOM-PACKAGE_STRUCTURE] [T:FILE_NAME_INDICATOR-NOTICED] [00:15:14] Interviewee: I understand that they’re files. So my standard *Not sure about the “standard” word * and they tell me like the name of the file. [00:15:23] But I don't get what the colors represent, um, as that's partially, because by the time you, we kind of like, see what's come out I. Yeah, this is great. And it's got one out of two and it's spawned two bugs. *Talking about a sub-dir with only 2 bugs in it*
[T:COLORS-GENERAL_QUALITY] [00:15:47] I guess the overall feeling of it is a sense of something's wrong. 
[00:15:56] Interviewee: Um, let me try to get back up to the top left corner. *Rush to the top by staying very close to the right wall*
[00:16:00] Interviewer: So you don’t have any idea what the colors are for?
[T:COLORS-GENERAL_QUALITY] [T:COMBAT-PACE_OVERWHELMING] [00:16:08] Interviewee: Rather they represent the, like what's going on in the file. So if it's got bugs, uh, if it’s got code smells. Um, though, it is hard to see because you can't see that many —. And your screen is a bit overwhelmed. 
[T:FREEZE_INFORMATION-INTUITIVE] [T:TILE_NUMBER-INTUITIVE] That's like, this is six out of, uh, this is 12 and it's got a massive.*Talking about a sub-dire with 12 issues and a critical bug spawning* *Open de freeze information panel* Uh, a massive bug.
[00:16:40] So, a big bug, which I assume is very important, at least it needs to be fixed. Um, I wonder if I could get inside that if I actually see that existing.
[T:MOUSE-NOT_FOUND] [T:FREEZE_FREEZE-MISSED] [00:16:58] Interviewer: I see that you’re having a lot of trouble navigating. So, when you are in the freeze mode. You can actually still move around the camera. And you can also click on the square to get inside and right click to go up. 
[T:ISSUE_ACCESS-COOL] [00:17:20] Interviewee: Yep. Okay. *Hover things with the mouse* *Click on a monster* Oh it brings me to the details on SonarCloud. [00:17:32] Interviewer: Yeah, when you click on a code smell or vulnerability it will open the details. [00:17:36] Interviewee: oh, okay. Okay. Yeah. Okay. That's, that's interesting. 
Um, I must've miss-clicked. Okay. Yeah, that makes sense.
[T:MOUSE-USEFUL] [T:FILE_HOVER-INTUITIVE] [T:EXPLORING-HARD_WHEN_MONSTERS] [T:FREEZE_FREEZE-USEFUL_TO_LOOK_AROUND] [T:COMBAT-PACE_OVERWHELMING] [00:17:49] Interviewer: So how is it to navigate like this? [00:17:55] Interviewee: Um, that definitely makes it a lot easier because before it was just really overwhelming. *Open freeze menu and hover elements there*
[00:18:16] Interviewer: Does it help you better understand what the colors mean?
[T:RAINBOW-INTUITIVE] [T:RAINBOW-LEFT_TO_RIGHT] [T:COLORS-GENERAL_QUALITY] [00:18:24] Interviewee: Um, I, I mean, maybe. There's a lot of issues here and everything's green. Uh, which is based on toe the rainbow *Note: not sure about what they are saying here*. It looks to me that maybe this means this is okay. 
[T:SECURITY_METRIC-NOTICED] [00:18:46] Um, yes. I got the walls as well, which say yes, no security vulnerability or is not found 
[T:MAINTAINABILITY_METRIC-CRACKS_NOT_FOUND] [T:MAINTAINABILITY_METRIC-CONFUSING] [00:18:56] And there's no cracks present that I can see. Um, but then there are a large number of issues or some things that, uh, uh, display this. Um, so that's a bit confusing. 
[T:FILE_NAME_INDICATOR-NOTICED] Um, I guess that the ground here is saying that this components package or whatever it is *Pointing to and reading the current folder label on top left corner*, is not very reliable based on the things that are here.
[T:MAINTAINABILITY_METRIC-CRACKS_NOT_FOUND] [T:MAINTAINABILITY_METRIC-CONFUSING] [00:19:31] Um, but again, I can't really see any cracks, but you when you play the game. All the things that come out. Um, the majority of them are code smells. So, that's a little bit confusing, and I may just be looking in the wrong spot.
[00:20:03] Interviewer: How would you rate this room in terms of severity, how would you rate it? Good, medium, bad or very bad.
[T:RAINBOW-INTUITIVE] [T:RAINBOW-LEFT_TO_RIGHT] [T:RELIABILITY_METRIC-NOTICED] [00:20:16] Interviewee: In terms of bugs, it seems very middle ground and middle ground to me is not what you generally want to aim for. Uh, we should be aiming to have, uh, like as few bugs as you can, you know, cause if SonarQube can spot the bugs.
[00:20:38] Then that means that this obviously both very, quite a basic one, um, and looked at the bugs. It, so if — code smells, so there's no point having those ones in there, —
[00:20:45] Interviewer: Okay, and in terms of vulnerability?.
[T:SECURITY_METRIC-NOTICED] [00:20:55] Interviewee: that looks for. Um, so the vulnerability looks fine. Um, [00:21:00] yeah, it would be something, uh, To, to whatever tool I'm using. I can understand that. Yeah. Okay. This place is fine. Uh, for vulnerabilities, it's not an issue.
[00:21:17] Interviewer: All right. When you were playing just before and fighting the monsters what did you think about the combat aspect?
[T:COMBAT-PACE_OVERWHELMING] [T:COMBAT-FORCES_DIGGING] [T:EXPLORING-HARD_WHEN_MONSTERS]  [00:21:32] Interviewee: Like it's a bit clunky, I guess, um, hit boxes a little bit *Maybe not talking about hitboxes*, uh, folks, you like to create a movement so that, um, but then it does sort of give that feeling that you really do have to dig down into each file, um, to actually tackle the things like if you just look at it from a top level perspective, There's hundreds of creatures trying to kill you and you can only really handle only one thing at once. 
[T:MAP-USABILITY_GOOD] *Open the map and scroll the list of suggested files. But not with the mouse on it. The scroll seems to be working even if the mouse pointer is not on the list*
[00:22:12] Interviewer: When playing this game do you think it would motivate you to fix the technical debt? The bugs, the code smells because of playing the game. 
[T:FIXING-FOR_MY_PROJECT] [00:22:24] Interviewee: Honestly, it could be something like that. It would, it would have to be a project that I'm working on and I understand more fully, of course. Cause then it would be something where I can say, okay, like I understand that there could be something we are like, if. [00:22:40] If you knew exactly what the file is, if it like actually had the name of what’s happening. Um, and then, so I can like, see like, okay. It would sort of be more closely related to what I do when I actually fix the code smells. Seem I could more, more closely mapped that to, to the game and to what I do I use when I'm fixing them. 
[00:23:26] Interviewer: Okay. That makes sense. Of course it would be more relatable if it was like your project. Um, but then if it was one of your projects and you were using this tool… No more like, would you use this tool in your everyday life?
[T:REQUIREMENT-BIG_PROJECT] [T:ME-NEGATIVE] [00:23:49] Interviewee: um, I think there are benefits, I think, with what I do not so much. So more of the stuff that I do currently is. Uh, not necessarily big projects but more smaller scripts in Python or a JavaScript or whatever, um, that I used sort of supplement, uh, how I would go about, uh, mocking and, uh, creating assignments and things like that.
[T:ME-POSITIVE] [T:SCENARIO-ASSIGNMENT_MARKING]  [00:24:23] Um, in the scope of, uh, like, uh, the CDs project course here. Um, I definitely could make sense for me to use it. Like if I go through a mock, so if I'm looking for code smells or I'm marking this assignment that, you know, it could be used alongside, I think like SonarQube, um, which, uh, also, like SonarCloud. [00:24:49] So when I click on that, I can see, uh, the exact issue, um, So, yeah, I do think is the ability to use it, um, when sort of reviewing code bases and trying to understand if people have actually put in like effort and made sure that they're not just hacking stuff together.  
[T:ME-CLASSIC_VIS_EASIER] [T:ME-CLASSIC_VIS_MORE_COMPLETE] [00:25:17] But, I think dashboards, like SonarCloud. Uh, well, I really had, uh, had experience with SonarQube. Um, I think that makes it simple enough. Um, cause I don't actually need to go in and fix them, um, to understand, I might just look and see like, okay, have they got any empty methods? Have they got —? Like, is this a reoccurring thing or is it just like a one-time thing?
[T:EXPLORING-HARD_WHEN_MONSTERS] [T:FILE_HOVER-INTUITIVE]  [00:25:49] Um, And within the game, it's hard to tell exactly what things are. So if I still have to hover on each thing, um, but [00:26:00] the fact that I have to hover things while I'm trying to move around. Like I can also do that *Freeze*.
[00:26:10] That's, you know, it’s not very structured. Yeah. 
[00:26:27] Interviewer: So you mean, you prefer a more specific view, like more detailed on the bugs and code smells? 
[T:SCENARIO-DEBT_FIGHT_ENGAGEMENT] [00:26:35] Interviewee: Yeah. Um, I find the, there would be times maybe where this would be good. Um, like, especially if I'm thinking about it from more of a teaching perspective, this would make students more inclined to, um, think about code smells.
[T:DILEMMA_TOOL-MISSING_INFORMATION] [00:26:54] So think about all these other abilities I'm thinking about, um, bugs, but in terms of actually playing it, you don't get enough raw information. I feel about the specific types of bugs and where they are, and like the descriptions and things, 


[T:ISSUE_ACCESS-INTUITIVE] because each time they move, if you want us to understand, you've got to click on.
[T:DILEMMA_TOOL-DETAILS_HARD_TO_ACCESS] [00:27:17] And then you've got to open up a new tab, but you have to open up that, that has to load, you have to wait until it shows you that issue. And then at that point, like here, I'm not sure exactly where this has come from us. It was coming from, and it is a /mac/copy_binary.py *Name of the file*. [00:27:41] And I have to look around to work out where exactly that's wrong. And if it's inside like a, uh, box, then I can't tell. Right. Cause it just does. And where did it come from? [00:28:02] *Looking for the source of a bug by reading the source of the issue then hovering multiple sub-dir to try to find it*
[00:28:13] Interviewer: uh, you mentioned teaching. Do you think then that, uh, it would be a good idea to use this kind of video game to teach so for students?
[T:COMBAT-OVERWHELMING_IS_BAD_CODE] [T:TEACHERS-POSITIVE] [T:SCENARIO-TEACH] [00:28:26] Interviewee: Yeah. So I think one thing that I, that very much clicked with me is it does feel overwhelming. And I think that that's something that. Well, yeah, as I said, so, you know, it feels overwhelmed. There's all these little things that you have to hack your way at and have to kill them. Or you sort of, if you can map that to the difficulty and teach students that, Hey, look, you know, as your project grows, you're going to have more and more like — [00:29:00] you know, smells in them that like go on and create a messy project. [00:29:06] And then when you're trying to just wander around it and have a look at these bugs that come up and you have to go all the way in, like the individual files to actually deal with them. Um, and if you don’t, you know, then you just, it comes to like with you can't really, move around. [00:29:26] I couldn't easily navigate, uh, with all the code smells in the bugs. Yeah
[00:29:36] Interviewer: Yeah. So it would be like overwhelming, but like in a good way to teach the students about not letting their code base too big with lots of code smells. 
[T:SCENARIO-DEBT_FIGHT_ENGAGEMENT] [00:29:46] Interviewee: Yeah, exactly. Um, but in terms of making them actually go and fix like that specific bug... Maybe with the bigger monsters. Um, so to make — as something like the big ones. [00:30:08] So the critical things in, you know, you can go through play and you could see like, oh, this is a big … see that *points at big bug*. Maybe that you can't actually beat until you go back into the code, fix it and know, push it to the repository. And then when you reload the game, then your smell go and you can sort of more easily navigate. 
[00:30:35] Interviewer: Okay. And, um, except for students and teachers, do you think that this, uh, tool could, um, benefits to any other role maybe in software companies or any other place you can think of ?
[T:DEV-LOW] [T:FREQUENCY-TRY_BY_CURIOSITY] [00:30:52] Interviewee:  um,  I think that could be some benefit and, you know, like regular software development.
[00:30:59] Um, [00:31:00] but I wonder if it's sort of at the stage where it's not necessarily finely tuned enough. Um, because especially if I was like writing software, I wouldn't be able to use it to fix myself with, it would be interesting to go through and have a little look Through the file structure, see all the different issues and stuff, but it's not, it's not maintainable.
[00:31:33] And like with the, here , you know, I can see a major code smell. Um, which I don't really know. I think that it's like I click on it, I look here at another major code smell. Are they from the same place? Yeah. *pointing at another major code smell* Major code smell 
[T:ROOM_INFORMATION-OVERWHELMING] So from somewhere else? Yeah, it is what you might be to say that it's different. Um, yeah, it's… there's too much going on, on the screen.
[00:32:01] Interviewer: in terms of information. It's a bit overwhelming ?
[T:ROOM_INFORMATION-OVERWHELMING] [00:32:05] Interviewee: Yeah. Um, so it's very overwhelming. It seems that like this whole, like everything sort of looks the same or at least with code smells. Maybe that's just the code base. But that's like, there's no, there's no order to it on the enemies (not sure). And then with the, the, um, the sort of files or sub directories there, you can see a bit more sort of information.
[T:ME-CLASSIC_VIS_EASIER] [00:32:35] We see like, okay, this, uh, this folder. Is it a folder? Yes it’s a folder. It’s good vulnerability wise. Um, but it's got some reliability issues. Um, but then I don't know if that's something that really makes it easier in seeing a dashboard. Um,[00:33:00] 
[00:33:05] Interviewer: maybe if you have anything else to say? the things that you like or disliked about the game that we haven't covered yet, maybe ?
[T:ISSUE_ACCESS-SLOW_LOADING] [T:SONARCLOUD_INTEGRATION-MISSING] [T:ISSUE_ACCESS-USEFUL] [00:33:19] Interviewee: I think — like having it open Sonarcloud, it's quite nice. It does take a lot of time to load. I mean, maybe that's something that's completely out of your hand. And in that case, you know, there’s nothing wrong. But if it's something with, maybe if I already had sonar cloud open in another window or another tab and like hit it split screen or half and half, [00:34:00] if I clicked on [an issue] and it lead, like sort of took me to that place on the page. [00:34:05] Um, so instead of having to reload the page. Reload a new tab each time.  
[T:SONARCLOUD_INTEGRATION-MISSING] [00:34:13] Interviewer: You are thinking about having this tool combined with sonarcloud on one side sonarcloud and on the other the visual representation? [00:34:23] Interviewee: Yeah. Um, because I feel like having sonarcloud makes it much easier to understand like the actual issues that are going on. [00:34:34] Um, but seeing. The things in the game, gives maybe a better idea of how severe it is. So I'd hope that in a good code base, you know, I can walk around, uh, somewhat freely, um, and I don't have all these mess and things, but if, you know, if I just want it to sort of have a little bit of fun while I'm trying to work. [00:35:02] Uh, to the code smells. I can go in here and instantly I see. Okay, well, this is a big issue, right? Um, I have to work out well to get the resources. It's very tough to get there. And then from that, I can sort of tell like, Hey, maybe I should look more here. And then I can like go into the sonar cloud and actually have a look at these issues and, a more [00:35:29] Understandable way like this as a big blob of things, it gets the volume across and it gets maybe a bit of the idea of, okay, there's some big code smells and what not, but it doesn't really, it doesn't actually get across the actual information. Yeah
