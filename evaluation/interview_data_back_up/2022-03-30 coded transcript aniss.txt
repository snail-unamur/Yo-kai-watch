[T:UNDERSTANDING] [00:02:37] Interviewee: No, I'm trying to put things together here. It seems like there's like I can make the safe.
[T:GAMEPLAY] [00:02:47] I don't do a  lot of damage. There's not a lot of upgrades. Seems like this is just unnecessarily extra.[00:03:00] 
[T:UNDERSTANDING] [Q:4] [00:03:15] Interviewee: I feel like. Oops. I feel like I'm getting an idea of like, uh, maybe like a data leak or something it's like, it's just unnecessarily complicated way too much on the screen. Like everything just keeps happening. I don't have any agency here. Like no matter what I do, I'm just getting destroyed, so.
[T:INFORMATION] [00:04:08] Interviewee: this is so much to put together. Yeah. 
[T:INFORMATION] [00:04:17] Interviewee: That is way too much information. This is a, this is a lot to take in. 
[T:UNDERSTANDING] [Q:5] It's also, um, it's kind of difficult cause I'm not actually totally sure what I'm doing. . Like obviously I'm fighting these guys, but like, why am I fighting them? Like, why are they coming after me? I can see that they're labeled. I'm guessing this code base has a lot of code smells because it's all those guys. I think so the colors are, um, it seems like the colors are, uh, maybe like [00:05:00] the, um, what's the word it's like the level of, I guess yeah, like security of the code. I'm guessing. So like a, you know, protected, private, public. That's what I'm getting out of that.
[T:UNDERSTANDING] [Q:5] [00:05:19] Interviewee: Yeah. In the classes. Yeah. The maintainability part is getting me, a bit confused. Um, cause like, to me, like the kinds of player, like I'm thinking, I can't really do anything on those spots and so not really, not really totally sure if they do anything yet, if that makes sense. Yep. Um, also since I've, uh, logged myself out, that kind of changes things.
[T:UNDERSTANDING] [00:06:05] Interviewee: So this is making me think of like a, like a package structure. Like I just opened my IDE and now I've got all the files for this. [00:06:15] Yeah. Okay. Oh, okay. So I think, I think I understand now, so I like I'm. This is like one class or one file in the structure of the program. [00:06:28] And now I've got numbers on these tiles. That's confusing. [00:06:40] Numbers are decreasing. That's confusing. [00:06:46] Oh, okay. Now I'm understanding. Okay. So I'm I just went, I think I just went down into a, um, yeah. Okay. So let's make more sense. So I've got, this is like the re like the top level class, and then I just went down to the packages [00:07:00] and then yeah. [00:07:03] Yeah, that makes more sense. 
[T:UNDERSTANDING] [00:07:06] Interviewee: Yeah, it's starting to sense, but, um, user documentation. Okay. So I'm guessing since there's no documentation, there's no code in here. So when DNA Emmys, there's no smells in comments. That's just the JSON file. This is just the JSON file. [00:07:21] and so like each square is representative of like another directory or file within that packet. 
[T:UNDERSTANDING] [00:07:28] not so sure that fighting these guys who've been doing anything like, is this just, you know, like, I don't think that there's a goal yet. This is just showing me that there's a lot of data in this file. 
[T:UNDERSTANDING] [Q:5] [00:07:56] Interviewee: Okay, so, [00:08:00] okay. Okay. I think I see it now. The, the walls. Are telling me that maybe that's like a level of security, like maybe that's the level of like the, the more, um, like volatile the smell is,[00:08:22] and the reliability of the bugs. Okay. So that's probably like how often you can replicate those bugs. So it looks like all of these are the furthest right one. I'm not sure if that's the most or the least
[T:TUTORIAL] [00:08:39] Interviewee: Yeah. I don't know which end of it is higher and lower. 
[T:TUTORIAL] [00:08:42] Um, cracks. I don't think I've seen any cracks have I? 
[T:UNDERSTANDING] [00:09:05] Interviewee: So if I was going to go based on how many of the, uh, how many of the guys I was getting, like how many guys on screen? That would make me think that like that's more intense [00:09:22] cause like this one's got 2 91 and it's like, it just fills the whole screen up. So. And that's in the middle. So I think probably darker means more vulnerability, more bugs, more code smells because the screen is like this. There's no question. It's like, literally you just like to get here and there's 6,000 guys. Um, maybe I'll go to a different file.
[T:TUTORIAL] [00:09:47] It feels devy. Oh, I see you. It's just, 
[T:UNDERSTANDING] [00:09:50] let's do a Python file. Seems safer.[00:10:00] [00:10:06] Oh, wow. So I'm guessing this person has perfect code.
[T:UNDERSTANDING] [00:10:26] Interviewee: Um, it took a, it took a little bit to figure it out, but. Like I had to, I had to make the connection that, um, me as a player I'm, I'm like iterating through the packages. Like I had to think about that. Like that was hard to think about.
[T:UNDERSTANDING] [00:10:40] And then once I got it, it was like, oh, okay. Makes sense. I'm just like going down right there through the file structure, 
[T:INFORMATION] [00:10:51] Interviewee: um, Here are the information is fine. I think this is, this makes sense because I live, I can only interact in one way with the keyboard and one way with the mouse. Yeah. So that's fine. [00:11:00] Um, I think, uh, this is like, really, like, Devy like, this is like, it feels like a debug screen.
[T:TUTORIAL] [00:11:09] Um, like it's, it's nice. Um, that it has like, there's all this information because if I want to, I can just open it up and read it. Yeah. But like, it could be easier, you know, maybe like introduce it in chunks or something. And the tutorial, like, was it, hold on. Where's the tutorial, um, had some information. Yeah.
[T:TUTORIAL] [00:11:37] So this, yeah, this, this tutorial screen is like, I think this is fine because like, this is telling me like, just the basics, like, this is what you're doing. As a player, I'm thinking like, oh, this is a game, you know, like I'm going to play this like a game, but then when you start actually like playing and like going into files and stuff, it's like, 
[T:UNDERSTANDING] [T:TUTORIAL] [00:12:02] Interviewee: Yeah, exactly. It's uh, I feel like, um, like in a way, like you get in here. Okay, this is a game. I wanna play like a game and then you start fighting the guys and then you're like, okay, I'm not really doing much.
[T:UNDERSTANDING] [00:12:16] This one's a little bit. Okay. These guys stopped fine. Okay. So, I mean, from that I get like, like that's novel, I think. Did I just like fight all of my code smells. That's what I'm getting out of that.
[T:GAMEPLAY] [Q:6] [00:12:42] Interviewee: Uh, okay. If I'm gonna be perfectly honest, uh, having only one attack, pretty lame, uh, no offense or anything. It's just what it is. Um, I really like having options, especially for a top-down like, this is a, like, I got the reference, um, the coding of Isaac or [00:13:00] whatever. Right. So I played a ton of binding of isaac right. And like, you only have one ability and that's the shoot, but then like, you know, the abilities change as you do things and it gives you so many options. That's like attacking enemies. Like you should have a lot of variation. 
[T:USAGE] [Q:8] [Q:9] [00:13:25] Interviewee: Um, yeah. I can see myself using this tool, um, to like, you know, just like, I'm not sure I would use it all the time. Like, I mean, I feel like probably like during milestones.
[T:USAGE] [Q:9] [00:13:36] Be like, did it get easier or harder? Um, just to figure things out, but it, like, it makes sense, like, this is smart now, like now that I've figured out what it's actually doing, um, it feels like, 
[T:UNDERSTANDING] I mean, obviously if I, if I go into one of my files or one of the projects and I just get dummied destroyed, I'm like, okay, there's a problem here.
[T:UNDERSTANDING] [00:13:55] I need to do something. Um, without actually reading the code. I have no [00:14:00] idea. I mean, obviously, like I'm gonna, I'm going to imagine that the, um, the, the complexity is tied with how many enemies there are, or like the amount of code smells. Um, so like, obviously if it's, you know, if you're getting destroyed on one screen and you're like, I should probably check that file out.
[00:14:18] Yeah. That makes sense. 
[T:USAGE] [Q:9] [00:14:24] Interviewee: Yeah. Yeah. So like, um, I mean, obviously it's different for every team, but like, um, let's say you want to get like a minimum viable product, play it, then, um, see how you are with a minimal viable product.
[00:14:33] And then when you decide that you want to do, starting to start doing like alpha testing, then try it again. And then like compare the difference between viable, minimal viable product. And then the alpha test did the same thing with like the beta testing, you know, like take it in steps and then like, you know, I would use that to be like, to understand better.
[00:14:48] Like if we increased complexity, do we take more technical debt? Onto board, which you would assume, but like, was it worth it? Like, you know what I mean? Like I'm [00:15:00] imagining, like, doing like, um, I don't know, I'm seeing this from like a scrum point of view. I just did a three 70. So I'm like, I'm thinking of things of like a burndown chart.
[00:15:08] Like, you know, we're going to have this done here. We're going to have this much done here. So then we're going to test here, like see how complex it is here, and then we're gonna have this much done here. We're going to test again there just to like, have an idea of. How complex it's getting and what it actually is doing.
[T:DILEMMA] [00:15:23] Um, but that being said though, like, it's, now it feels like it's, um, it's kind of like split between a game or a tool. And that's, I think that's difficult because it's like pitching a game and a tool it's really difficult, I think, because it's like, how do I make it fun and also informative? 
[T:DILEMMA] [00:15:39] When you're stuck between making a game and a tool, I feel like those are conflicting problems, like solving those problems. Because if you want a tool, you want a ton of information you want like to see everything all at once. But if you want to play a game, you want to be introduced to just enough and like, Bump it up slowly, slowly, slowly.
[T:DILEMMA] [00:15:59] Yeah. [00:16:00] So it's, it's difficult then, because now I understand why we have this screen here is like, obviously you want to teach people what's going on. But like, I guess the main distinction there is main making people know this is a tool more than a game. Like this is a fun way to use a tool, right? It's like you're using a tool as a game.
[T:USERS] [Q:10] [00:16:39] Interviewee: um, I could see like, I think I could see students using this as like a fun way to do it. [00:16:46] Um, I think I could see teachers using this, like introducing students to this, like as a concept. Um[00:17:00] 
[T:USERS] [Q:10] [00:17:00] yeah. I mean, developers, that makes sense too, but I haven't, I haven't been in the industry too much. Like I've been interviewing and like doing side stuff, but like, it feels like to me, like an employer. Specifically in Saskatchewan and employer would be like, why would we play a game to figure out how our thing is?[00:17:17] Why don't we just run a sh like a ton of tests? You know what I mean? Like, I, I feel like in the business aspect, people are kind of like, go, go, go, just, just test it. Like, you don't need to fool around with playing it and seeing how it works. 
[T:USERS] [Q:10] [00:17:28] But I feel like maybe in a game dev studio, it'd be a bit different because they're all about novelty and ideas and iteration and finding out what's different. 
[00:17:35] I come on to find a file. That's like, just like the worst code written and just has a thousand guys on the screen. 
[T:LIKE] [Q:1] [00:18:17] Interviewee: Okay. Um, I liked the art, um, so far. The, um, the only thing I would change, but I'm kind of artsy myself is I would change the colors a little bit. [00:18:28] I like the guy, the main guy, cause he's like, he's, he's he contrasts really hard. Like you can see him everywhere. Yeah. So that's good. 
[T:DISLIKE] [Q:2] Um, I think these colors could be switched up a bit. Like something maybe that's easier on the eyes. I don't know. I don't know. I imagine like, if you're, if you're using it as a tool to see what's complex and what there's, what there is like in your code, um, let's say you want to check out your entire code base.[00:18:52] It's gonna take you a while. Um, but you'd maybe want to have something that's less like, contrasting like these colors, like don't, I don't think that they compliment each other very well.[00:19:02] I think it's that they're like, um, they're just kind of. Harsh on the eyes, I guess like it's I know that they're like pinks and purples, but like the way that they go from a range of like a light one to a really dark one, it's kind of like, it's not as, um, like appealing, I guess.[00:19:17] I don't know. Like I would, I would imagine doing like maybe a pastel or. Yeah, something that's just like softer on the eyes that you can just look at it and just not feel so fatigued from, you know, 
[T:LIKE] [Q:1] [00:19:41] Interviewee: Like I think this is a bit better.(about the rainbow color theme) It's there's not as much saturation of the colors, which is like, it's better. I think, um, Yeah, I think that's a bit better. So it strikes again. Yep. 
[T:LIKE] [Q:1] [00:19:55] That's gonna take a while um, another, another thing I liked, um, [00:20:00] um, it's like organized really well. [00:20:02] Just like squares blocks, you know, you can, you can see it's organized well, um, even if the information is really complex. Yeah.
[T:LIKE] [Q:1] [00:20:12] The, um, the like, like slight little details for animation is good because I feel like it doesn't have to be like technically impressive, you know, it doesn't have to be like so flashy because you're just navigating it. Right. Um, yeah, this color works better. I think it's calling makes more sense. Okay. Um,
[T:MAP] [00:20:40] um, I thought that this was simple too, but if you're going to use this as a map screen, I think you should maybe, um, show the entire structure to the player so that they can click in really quick that it's like, oh, this is the whole file structure. Like maybe a mini map or something. Yeah, that would be good.
[T:UNDERSTANDING] [00:20:58] [00:21:00] Um, you know, 52. Okay. So nice biggest room we've gone to, I've never seen of these guys before at school. That's what kind of guys? That vulnerability.
[00:21:15] Interviewer: Yeah. So this is what we wanted to do with X screen. Like basically, if you forget about. Uh, some monster as you don't remember, you just press X and you know, 
[T:GAMEPLAY] [00:21:25] Interviewee: oh yeah. It's and you can figure it out. Yeah. So that's like, that's making me think of like having a log book then like, um, maybe when you defeat the enemy, uh, if you've played like Castlevania games or something.
[T:GAMEPLAY] [00:21:35] Yeah. Like you defeat the enemy and then you have like a book that has like that enemy. What they do, something like a little writing snippet about them. Like I like stuff like that. That's that's awesome. I just played disc room and had the same thing. Like every desk you die too. It gives you a. A little description about them and like a little flavor text.[00:21:51] And I love that because it's just like another layer into the writing, how things work. Um, that's that seems like more onto the game side of things though. Yeah.[00:22:00] 
[T:GAMEPLAY] [00:22:05] it's getting a little chunky (laggy). 
[T:GAMEPLAY] [00:22:09] Interviewee: That's, that's, uh, I guess as another point, um, maybe, uh, like, I mean, you could limit the amount of guys on screen, you know, and then you like have to deal with them at once. 
[T:UNDERSTANDING] But like, I mean, then I'm more confused too though, because it's like, as I'm killing these guys, am I really like, am I doing anything? [00:22:25] Am I having. 'cause. I remember the one room I had guys come at me and I killed them all. And then like I was at, so yeah. Uh, 
[T:UNDERSTANDING] [00:22:45] Interviewee: Yeah. Like to, yeah. Yeah. I think then, uh, it may be easy to, um, I just communicate to the player that it's like, I mean, I'm sure like this would come in like the description of what the project does, but, um, just to communicate to the player, it's [00:23:00] like, oh, you beat that room. So like, that's manageable for you, 
[T:GAMEPLAY] [T:DILEMMA] [00:23:07] but then also you have the idea of, um, uh, players skill levels. So, you know what I mean? Like, I mean, there's obviously people who just can't do that. Right. So it's like, is that, does that mean it's too complex for them or does that mean that, you know, other people are just better games, you know? So that's confusing too.
